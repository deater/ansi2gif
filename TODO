VGA font is actually 9-bits wide

+ a default font with IBM extended ASCII codes more suitable for ANSI art.
+ color-map settable from command line
+ automatic sizing of output gif based on ansi
+ handle background color and line-feed properly (background should
	continue to edge I think)
+ full 24-bit ANSI colors for gif/png

Far-Out-There
+ Scrolling animated gif.  I.e. simulate the console when y>y_size

+ Input from stdin, output to stdout?
+ Fuzz testing
